# ProjectMEMRAM
Old Repository for the now Closed-Source Zicroram Software

This is what it once used to be the main repository for the Memram Project System I did at my University,
the system has thus been renamed to Zicroram and can be found here:

1 - Shareware Version of the Product:
https://github.com/srmfx/Zicroram

2 - Actual System Project(Closed Source Code, non-accessible)
https://github.com/srmfx/ProjectZICRORAM

While the shareware version of the product is available to public,
the main project & full system has been made closed-source.

This repository is only being kept for reference.
